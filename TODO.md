- ~~write extension and load it into sqlite3~~
- write extension and load it into sqlite3 in zig
- fix `duration(time)` in zig
- per project durations `duration(time, project)` in zig/c
- `timeline(time, project)`???
- `bucket(time, project)`???
- need a windowing function, I think
- what about ordering, is it correct? time_next > time_prev?
